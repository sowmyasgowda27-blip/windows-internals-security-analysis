# Windows Internals Security Analysis (Blue Team Project)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on understanding critical Windows system processes
from a defensive cybersecurity (Blue Team) perspective.

The goal is to establish a baseline of normal behavior and identify
suspicious activity that could indicate attacks such as credential
dumping or process masquerading.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand core Windows processes and their security relevance
- Analyze parent–child process relationships
- Differentiate normal vs suspicious process behavior
- Build a Blue Team / SOC analyst mindset

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Windows Task Manager
- Sysinternals Process Explorer
- Windows Event Viewer
- PowerShell (basic commands)

## 📂 Project Structure
This repository will include:
- Normal behavior analysis of Windows processes
- Suspicious behavior simulations (safe & legal)
- Event log observations
- Detection-thinking notes
- Lessons learned

## 🚀 Why This Project Matters
Attackers often abuse trusted Windows processes to remain stealthy.
Security analysts must understand what “normal” looks like in order
to detect anomalies and respond effectively. Also, this is to help lot of beginners, aspiring to enter Cybersecurity.
